# Change Pfp
Changing the pfp is as simple as replacing the photo in the src folder, with a square photo of whatever. (make sure its named pfp.png) Note it will always have a border unless you change it in style.css on line 32. you can also change the roundness of the pfp on line 31. (I recommend always using "rem" for the border-radius)
here is the css
